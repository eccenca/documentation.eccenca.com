# Marketplace Packages

Beginning from version 26.1, we support the creation and use of Marketplace Packages.

Marketplace Packages are a mechanism to wrap everything belonging to a certain configuration of a Corporate Memory based solution or project into a single sharable and managed artifact:

-   Vocabularies / Ontologies
-   (SKOS) Taxonomies
-   (Instance / Data) Graphs
-   BUILD Projects
-   Dependencies to
    -   [python-plugins](../python-plugins/index.md)
    -   (other) Marketplace Packages

The following pages give an overview about this feature:
