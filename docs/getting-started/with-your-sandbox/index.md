# Welcome to your eccenca Corporate Memory Sandbox

!!! info inline end ""

    ![Your are here](overview-cmem.drawio.svg "You are here")

Thank you for registering your eccenca Corporate Memory Sandbox! We're excited to have you on board and look forward to showing you how Corporate Memory can help you with your data management needs. We hope that you find this experience valuable and informative. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. Thanks again for joining us!

eccenca's Corporate Memory is a platform for creating and managing Enterprise Knowledge Graphs. It has three main stages: _Build_, _Explore_, and _Consume_. In the _Build_ stage, you can convert legacy data points from existing datasets into a Knowledge Graph structure. The _Explore_ stage allows you to interact with your Knowledge Graph, while the _Consume_ stage is used to retrieve information from the graph and integrate it programmatically with your IT infrastructure.

-   :fontawesome-brands-dropbox:{ .lg .middle } __Sandbox Resources__

    ---

    The sandbox includes a sample build project named _"Product Data Integration Demo"_ and the graphs generated by that project, as well as an integration graph as an entry point: _"Products - Integration"_. Shacl shapes are provided for the product vocabulary. These are used in the Business Knowledge Editor module for visual exploration as well as in a custom workspace configuration called _Product Data Integration_ to demonstrate how the user interface can be customized.

-   :material-script-text-play-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Tutorials and Examples__

    ---

    Our [tutorials](../../tutorials/index.md){target=_blank} help you to create Knowledge Graphs and to use the exploration and consumption features. To get started, we recommend:

    -   [Lift tabular sources (CSV, XSLX, JDBC)](../../build/lift-data-from-tabular-data-such-as-csv-xslx-or-database-tables/index.md){target=_blank}
    -   [Active Learning of Linking Rules](../../build/active-learning/index.md){target=_blank}
    -   [Building a customized User Interface](../../explore-and-author/graph-exploration/building-a-customized-user-interface/index.md){target=_blank}
    -   [Populate Data to Neo4j](../../consume/populate-data-to-neo4j/index.md){target=_blank}
    -   [Data in any Format via Custom API](../../consume/provide-data-in-any-format-via-a-custom-api/index.md){target=_blank}

-   :material-graph:{ .lg .middle } __BUILD__

    ---

    _BUILD_ data product pipelines that turn you existing data points into Enterprise Knowledge Graphs. Use them to create data product assembly lines in a visual, intuitive, and business-user friendly way.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more about _Build_](../../build/index.md){target=_blank}

-   :material-compass-rose:{ .lg .middle } __EXPLORE__

    ---

    With _EXPLORE_, you can interact with and visualize your Knowledge Graph data in both list and drill-down views. Configure custom front-end configurations to meet domain-specific needs without duplicating data.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more about _Explore_](../../explore-and-author/index.md){target=_blank}

-   :material-api:{ .lg .middle } __CONSUME__

    ---

    The _CONSUME_ tier provides several standard APIs for retrieving data from your Knowledge Graph. We also provide native integrations with [PowerBI](../../consume/consuming-graphs-in-power-bi/index.md){target=_blank} and [redash](https://redash.io/){target=_blank}.[Custom APIs](../../consume/provide-data-in-any-format-via-a-custom-api/index.md){target=_blank} can be configured to provide data in any format.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more about _Consume_](../../consume/index.md){target=_blank}

-   :other-powerautomate:{ .lg .middle } __AUTOMATE__

    ---

    With _AUTOMATE_, you can easily set up and automate processes in your Knowledge Graph. Our `cmemc` command line tool simplifies the management and migration of data and configurations in Corporate Memory. Learn about our vision of a DataOps process based on Corporate Memory, how to schedule workflows, and how to use variable data inputs.
