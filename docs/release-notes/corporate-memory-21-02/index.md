![21.02 cmemc Tree and Lists](21-02-cmemcTreeAndList.png "21.02 cmemc Tree and Lists")

The highlights of this release are:

- Build: Our re-designed mapping suggestion wizard make bootstrapping of your transformations a quick and easy exercise.
- Explore: interactively and visually browse through your graph with our integrated GRAPH visualization.
- Automate: The command line has never been more colorful, enjoyable and helpful (guessing your wishes as typos might happen). Experience the UX centric redesign of our command line client cmemc.

!!! warning

    With this release of Corporate Memory the DataIntegration, DataManager, DataPlatform configuration and cmemc command behavior has changed and have to be adapted according to the migration notes below.

This release delivers the following component versions:

- eccenca DataPlatform v21.02.1
- eccenca DataIntegration v21.02.1

More detailed release notes for these versions are listed below.

## eccenca DataIntegration v21.02.1

This version of eccenca DataIntegration adds the following new features:

- REST request operator:
    - added "Accept all SSL certificates" parameter in advanced section. Default: `false`.
- If the option `eccencaDataPlatform.writeGraphType` is set to true the a graph in CMEM generated by Dataintegration will contain a triple (`<graph> rdf:type di:Dataset`) indicating that this graph was written by DataIntegration.
- Improved mapping suggestion:
    - Allows to select from multiple matching candidates.
    - The user can switch between data source and target vocabulary view.
    - A sub-set of the vocabularies can be selected.
    - The user can pick any (non-matched) property from the target vocabularies via search.
    - Improved filtering and sorting.
    - Added multi word text search filter.
    - Allows to choose am existing or custom URI prefix for the auto-generated target properties.
    - Added tooltip for source paths with e.g. example values.

In addition to that, these changes are shipped:

- The "Timestamp to date" and "Date to timestamp" transformers support configurable time units and full `xsd:dateTime` values.
- Updated build to Spark 2.4, Scala 2.12 and sbt 1.x
- If a transformer inside a linkage rule throws a validation error, it will no longer fail the entire linking task, but will not generate a value for that transformer.
- In the linking evaluation view and the reference links view, validation errors are shown in the evaluation tree.
- Allow to persist caches between restarts in order to reduce application start-up time.

In addition to that, multiple performance and stability issues were solved.

## Migration Notes

### DataIntegration

- Timestamp to date operator changed default behavior
    - The "Timestamp to date" now assumes milliseconds instead of seconds by default. In addition, it generates full xsd:dateTime values instead of simple dates.
        - To makes sure that existing usages don't break, please open {DataIntegration}/api/core/usages/plugins/timeToDate and check all usages.
        - In order to revert to the previous behavior, the following changes have to be made to each usage:
            - Change the unit to "seconds".
            - Change the format to "yyyy-MM-dd"

### DataManager

- In your application.yml the following config property can be removed, if existing. This information is now internally provided by Datalatform: `js.modules.explore.graphlist.internalGraphs`

### DataPlatform

- in case you used Query Logging of DataPlatform you can remove the following environment variables as they are no longer needed: `QUERY_LOGGING_DIR`, `QUERY_LOGGING_MAX_FILE_SIZE`, `QUERY_LOGGING_TOTAL_SIZE_CAP`, `QUERY_LOGGING_MAX_HISTORY`

### cmemc

- `workspace import`|`export`|`reload` commands are deprecated now
    - use `admin workspace import`|`export`|`reload` commands instead
- Many commands have new default output:
    - `graph list`  command, use the `--id-only` or `CMEMC_GRAPH_LIST_ID_ONLY=true` to get the IRI list.
    - `project list` command, use the `--id-only` or `CMEMC_PROJECT_LIST_ID_ONLY=true` to get the ID list.
    - `workflow list` command, use the `--id-only` or `CMEMC_WORKFLOW_LIST_ID_ONLY=true` to get the ID list.
    - `graph list` command, use `--filter access readonly`|`writeable` instead of `--filter` `readonly`|`writeable`
- The command config check  was removed (was deprecated in v20.12)
