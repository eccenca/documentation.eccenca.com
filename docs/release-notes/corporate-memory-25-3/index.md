## Migration Notes

!!! info "Backward and Forward Compatibility"

    We do not guarantee forward compatibility for configuration, data or projects.
    I.e. importing a project created with DataIntegration v25.2.0 into DataIntegration v25.1.0 (or older) might not work.

    Backward compatibility will be ensured or migration paths explained.
    I.e. projects created with DataIntegration v24.3.0 can be imported into DataIntegration v25.1.0.

!!! info "Important info"

    Since v24.3.0, the components eccenca DataPlatform and eccenca DataManager are merged
    into a single component eccenca Explore.

### eccenca DataIntegration

- **Updated plugin identifiers:** To guarantee unique plugin identifiers, several configuration keys changed. The updates only affect configuration references—existing projects remain intact.
    - `workspace.provider.plugin`: `inMemory` → `inMemoryWorkspaceProvider`, `file` → `fileWorkspaceProvider`.
    - `workspace.repository.plugin`: `inMemory` → `inMemoryResourceRepository`, `file` → `sharedFileRepository`.
    - `workspace.reportManager.plugin`: `inMemory` → `inMemoryExecutionReportManager`, `file` → `fileExecutionReportManager`.
- **Python autocomplete:** Dropped support for autocomplete functions that omit the `depend_on_parameter_values` parameter. This was deprecated in 23.1; earlier versions logged warnings referencing “legacy autocomplete function”.
- **Python sub-system upgrade:** The Python runtime now uses Python 3.13 with uv-based package management.
    - If you previously set `PIP_INDEX_URL`/`PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL`, switch to [`UV_DEFAULT_INDEX`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/environment/#uv_default_index)/[`UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/environment/#uv_extra_index_url).
    - Custom CA bundles now reside at `/usr/local/venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem`.
    - Clean up the complete `python-packages` directory before or directly after upgrading (e.g., via `cmemc admin workspace python uninstall --all`).
    - Re-install required Python packages afterwards and ensure they are Python 3.13 compatible.
        - Please note that your packages need to be python 3.13 ready.
        - All [eccenca published plugins](https://documentation.eccenca.com/latest/tags/#tag:pythonplugin) are published as a new python 3.13 ready minor version.
    - If you maintain custom plugins using the [cmem-plugin-template](https://github.com/eccenca/cmem-plugin-template), update the template via copier as [described in the repository documentation](https://github.com/eccenca/cmem-plugin-template?tab=readme-ov-file#template-updates).

### eccenca Explore

- With the deprecation of the assistance feature, `assist.*` properties can be removed from your `application.yml`, they are not used any more and have been replaced by `spring.ai` configuration.
- If you are using (the deprecated) `shui:valueQuery` with any `sh:PropertyShape`, make sure you change the query signature to return the variable bindings `?resource` and `?graph`.
    The UI will display an error message if this is overlooked.
