## Migration Notes

!!! info

    We do not guarantee forward compatibility for configuration, data or projects.
    I.e. importing a project created with DataIntegration v24.1.0 into DataIntegration v23.3.0 (or older) might not work.

    Backward compatibility will be ensured or migration paths explained.
    I.e. projects created with DataIntegration v23.3.0 can be imported into DataIntegration v24.1.0.

### DataIntegration

There is a known issue and existing workaround with the new dependency port feature: you may receive a message like this when running your workflows:

```
Workflow Execution Error:
Not all workflow nodes were executed! Executed 2 of 7 nodes.
```

In this case, open the affected workflow in DataIntegration and click the save button once (no changes are required).
After saving it will work again.

### DataManager

#### Migrate Default Graph Override

If the default workspace sets a `exploreModuleConfiguration.defaultGraph` but an additional workspace is configured to show graph lists, you might see the following error message:

```
Missing Graph configuration for Context. Please check that the graph
""
actually exists.
```

Previously, un-setting the `exploreModuleConfiguration.defaultGraph` of the default workspace required setting its value to the empty string `""`.
The configuration now follows the standard pattern and expects an explicitly blocked value (i.e. setting it to `null`).
All non-default workspaces that previously set the `exploreModuleConfiguration.defaultGraph` to the empty string `""` need to be migrated by:

1. Open the workspace in the (workspace) **:material-cog-outline: Configuration**.
1. Open **Modules** > **Explore**.
1. Delete the empty `""` value of **defaultGraph** by clicking on the :material-trash-can-outline: icon.
1. Click on the **block button** to set it to `null`.
1. **Save** the workspace.

### DataPlatform

DP APIs do not return null values for unset fields anymore.

!!! warning

    Check if null values of non mandatory fields are expected if you are using the DataPlatform APIs with a custom client.

### cmemc

No migrations are required going from cmemc 23.3.x to 24.1.x.
