## eccenca DataIntegration v24.3.1

We're excited to bring you the latest update to DataIntegration v24.3, which introduces new features, improvements and bug fixes:

**v24.3.1 of DataIntegration adds the following new features:**

-   Added download button to workflow report tab.

**v24.3.1 of DataIntegration ships the following fixes:**

-   Task descriptions with long strings do not lead to horizontal scroll bars.
-   Tag search might very shortly show old search suggestions.
-   Missing unit for _Matching timeout_.
-   _Regex selection_ transformer has mis-formatted documentation.
-   Added JDBC dataset documentation on how to configure ANSI quotes for MySQL.
-   Superfluous `CREATE SILENT GRAPH` leads to slow update performance.
-   Fix SQL editor inputs.

**v24.3.0 of DataIntegration adds the following new features:**

-   Workspace search:
    -   Support to filter workflows that contain replaceable datasets.
    -   Display tags on workflow search items when they contain replaceable datasets.
    -   Add file name and graph URIs to search items as searchable tags.
-   Workflow editor:
    -   Support creating knowledge graph datasets from DataPlatform graphs matching the search query.
    -   Added copy prefixes option in copy task dialog.
-   Integration of a Prometheus endpoint to expose many useful metrics.
-   Transform operators to retrieve attributes from input tasks:
    -   _Input Task attributes_ retrieves individual attributes from the input task (such as the modified date) or the entire task as JSON.
    -   _Input file attributes_ retrieves a metadata attribute from the input file (such as the file name).
-   JdbcDialect implementation for Trino: Fixes STRING type mapping, adds isolationLevel option to avoid Connections resetting AutoCommit mode and serves as example for the dialect concept.
-   File hash transformer:
    -   Calculates the hash sum of a given file
    -   Works on either the input file dataset or a selected file from the project
-   JSON special paths:
    -   `#propertyName` accesses the current object key
    -   `*` selects all direct children of the current token
-   Add link from a task parameter description into the task's Markdown documentation for this parameter, if available.
-   Show sample (output) entities for workflow operators in the workflow reports.
-   Text dataset allows to configure the zip regex.
-   Support setting the locale for the `Parse date pattern` and `Parse date` transform operators.
    -   `*` selects all direct children of the current token
-   More fine-grained access control:
    -   In addition to a base action, it is possible to specify as many specific actions that protect specific endpoints.
    -   Endpoints are configured in a whitelist as URI prefixes per specific action.
    -   All endpoints that are protected by any specific action cannot be accessed anymore via the base action.
    -   Two new actions are configured by default and protect the Python plugin management and specific workspace API endpoints. See changes and migrations.
-   Global variables can be marked sensitive for storing passwords:
    -   Sensitive variables can only be used in password fields.
    -   Using sensitive variables in other fields or in variable templates fails and does not expose the value.
    -   Example:

        ```conf
        config.variables = {
            global = {
                sensitiveVar = {
                    value = "value 2"
                    isSensitive = true
                }
            }
        }
        ```

-   Delete project files operator: Allows to delete project files in a workflow based on a regex.
-   Added Snowflake dataset type.

-   docker image: switch to `eclipse-temurin:17-ubi9-minimal` base image
-   Prefix handling:
    -   Only prefixes added to a specific project are serialized/exported, no prefixes loaded by the workspace (e.g. from DP).
    -   Only load user prefixes and prefixes of installed vocabularies from DP into DI.
-   All datasets that support zips can be written now.
-   Increase visibility of breadcrumbs in application header.
-   Configurable Favicon in DataIntegration.

## Migration Notes

!!! info

    We do not guarantee forward compatibility for configuration, data or projects.
    I.e. importing a project created with DataIntegration v24.3.0 into DataIntegration v24.2.0 (or older) might not work.

    Backward compatibility will be ensured or migration paths explained.
    I.e. projects created with DataIntegration v24.2.0 can be imported into DataIntegration v24.3.0.

### eccenca DataIntegration

-   CSV files are no longer deleted by default at the beginning of a workflow execution. This behavior can be changed in the CSV dataset configuration.
-   Access control changes. Action URIs have been renamed and new actions are introduced by default:
    -   `urn:eccenca:di` -> `<https://vocab.eccenca.com/auth/Action/Build>` (will be handled by `cmemc admin migration`, see below).
    -   `urn:elds-backend-all-actions` -> `<https://vocab.eccenca.com/auth/Action/AllActions>` (will be handled by `cmemc admin migration`, see below).
    -   Python plugin management endpoints are now secured via `<https://vocab.eccenca.com/auth/Action/Build-AdminPython>` action.
    -   Workspace admin functions (reload workspace, import workspace) are now secured via `<https://vocab.eccenca.com/auth/Action/Build-AdminWorkspace>` action.

### eccenca Explore

!!! info inline end "Important info"

    Since v24.3.0, the components eccenca DataPlatform and eccenca DataManager are merged
    into a single component eccenca Explore.

This release introduces changes to internally used graphs (access control graph) and data structures (ACL actions, workspace configuration, chart integration, workflow trigger integration, table report integration).

For easy migration, we introduce a new cmemc command group that automates the necessary adjustments to use your configuration with v24.3: `cmemc admin migration`.

Test if migrations are required: `cmemc admin migration execute --test-only --all`.

Run a specific migration: `cmemc admin migration execute <recipe-id>`.

Run all migrations: `cmemc admin migration execute --all`.

### eccenca Corporate Memory Control (cmemc)

-   All scripts which used the `admin status` command with the `--key` option:
    -   adapt the key prefixes accordingly:
        -   old: `cmemc admin status --key dp.info.license.validDate`
        -   new: `cmemc admin status --key explore.info.license.validDate`
-   `admin store migrate` command deprecated
    -   use the `admin migration` command group instead
-   `--overwrite` options deprecated - will be removed with the next major version
    -   affected commands:
        -   `project import` command
        -   `project export` command
        -   `admin workspace export` command
-   All scripts which used the `admin metrics` command group:
    -   use combined metrics ID of `job_id:metrics_name`
    -   use `--filter job job_id` instead of `--job job_id`
