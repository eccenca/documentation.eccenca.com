## eccenca DataIntegration v24.2.1

We're excited to bring you the latest update to DataIntegration v24.2, which introduces new features, improvements and bug fixes:

v24.2.1 of DataIntegration ships the following fixes:

    -   Added `packageName` attribute to the plugin JSON.

v24.2.0 of DataIntegration introduces the following changes:

## Migration Notes

!!! info

    We do not guarantee forward compatibility for configuration, data or projects.
    I.e. importing a project created with DataIntegration v24.2.0 into DataIntegration v24.1.0 (or older) might not work.

    Backward compatibility will be ensured or migration paths explained.
    I.e. projects created with DataIntegration v24.1.0 can be imported into DataIntegration v24.2.0.

### DataIntegration

If during writing to a MySQL/MariaDB a `[…] You have an error in your SQL syntax […]` error is encountered make sure `ANSIquotes` are used.

`sql_mode=ANSI_QUOTES` can be set via a URL parameter to the JDBC connection string like:

```txt
# MySQL
jdbc:mysql://<host>:<port, eg. 3306>/<database>?sessionVariables=sql_mode=ANSI_QUOTES

# MariaDB
jdbc:mariadb://<host>:<port, eg. 3306>/<database>?sessionVariables=sql_mode=ANSI_QUOTES
```

### DataManager

`shacl2` feature flag was removed, the Shacl2 engine is now the system default. In case you had the `shacl2` feature flag set in the workspace configuration, it can now be removed.

### DataPlatform

-   Due to the update to Apache Jena 5 all JSON-LD output now conforms to JSON-LD 1.1 (was JSON-LD 1.0):
    -   JSON-LD 1.1 has been designed as a superset of 1.0, so we do not expect any problems, just making you aware that there _might_ be differences when using it with JSON-LD 1.0 and 1.1 processors at the same time (e.g. to compare results)
        > JSON-LD 1.1 introduces new features that are compatible with JSON-LD 1.0, but if processed by a JSON-LD 1.0 processor may produce different results (cf. [JSON-LD 1.1 Framing](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-framing/#features))
    -   Affected endpoints:
        -   `POST /proxy/{id}/resource/framed`
        -   `POST /proxy/{id}/sparql/framed`
        -   `POST /authorization/conditions/framed`
        -   `POST+GET /api/queries/jsonld/perform`
-   The Access Condition endpoint `GET /api/authorization/groups` returns now IRIs instead of names (including public/admin group).
-   Resource API endpoints `/proxy/{id}/resource` changed, the CBD calculation does not include reifications anymore.
-   The native stardog integration has been removed. As a stardog user you need to migrate your store configuration to use the generic HTTP-Store configuration option.

### cmemc

- The [`admin status`](../../automate/cmemc-command-line-interface/command-reference/admin/index.md#admin-status) command in combination with the `--exit-1 always` option now exits with status code 1 in the additional case that migrate-able workspace configurations are found
    -   To avoid this, you can automatically migrate the configurations with the [`admin store migrate`](../../automate/cmemc-command-line-interface/command-reference/admin/store/index.md#admin-store-migrate) command.
