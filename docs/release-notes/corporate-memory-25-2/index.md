## Migration Notes

!!! info "Backward and Forward Compatibility"

    We do not guarantee forward compatibility for configuration, data or projects.
    I.e. importing a project created with DataIntegration v25.2.0 into DataIntegration v25.1.0 (or older) might not work.

    Backward compatibility will be ensured or migration paths explained.
    I.e. projects created with DataIntegration v24.3.0 can be imported into DataIntegration v25.1.0.

!!! info "Important info"

    Since v24.3.0, the components eccenca DataPlatform and eccenca DataManager are merged
    into a single component eccenca Explore.

    -   Old Python plugins depending on Jython (Python 2.x)
    -   Spark scripting plugins
    -   Spark virtual dataset
    -   Legacy REST operator
-   To check if your instance uses any deprecated plugins, use the endpoint: `GET {DataIntegrationURL}/api/core/usages/deprecatedPlugins`

### eccenca Explore

-   **Query Catalog Query Type Changes** - Catalog managed queries no longer persist `shui:queryType`. Update and SELECT queries are now differentiated by `rdf:type`:
    -   SELECT queries use `shui:SparqlQuery`
    -   UPDATE queries use `shui:UpdateQuery`

### eccenca Corporate Memory Control (cmemc)

-   With the introduction of the `graph imports` command group, the `graph tree` command is now deprecated.
    -   use `graph imports tree` instead
