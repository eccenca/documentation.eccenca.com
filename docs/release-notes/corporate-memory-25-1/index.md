    3.   load `DEFAULT` value keys, but not for keys which are already set (i.e not override cli options or env variables)
    4.   load named INI section values (in case there is an INI section given) -> this will not overwrite everything
    5.   use API defaults if there are not enough config keys (use default `CMEM_BASE_URI`, default `OAUTH_GRANT_TYPE` and default `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`|`SECRET` if not present)


**In addition the following changes and fixes are included:**

-   `admin workspace python uninstall` command
    -   shell completion uses correct connection now
