!!! warning

    With this release of Corporate Memory the DataPlatform configuration and behavior has changed and have to be adapted according to the migration notes below.

This release delivers the following component versions:

* eccenca DataPlatform v22.1
* eccenca DataIntegration v22.1
* eccenca DataManager v22.1.1
* eccenca Corporate Memory Control (cmemc) v22.1.1

More detailed release notes for these versions are listed below.

## eccenca DataIntegration v22.1

This version of eccenca DataIntegration adds the following new features:

- Artifact creation dialogs now allows to set the parent project
- Added a parameter to JDBC datasets to allow clearing the table before workflow execution.
- Support for custom project and task identifiers at item creation time.
- Menu option to copy item ID to clipboard.
- Value type to represent geometry as WKT literals.
- Python plugin support
    - Initial support for workflow and transform plugins.
    - Plugins are executed in a Python 3 environment.
    - Check documentation for details: [Python Plugins](../../develop/python-plugins/)
- User-defined tags on projects and tasks.
- REST endpoint to fetch rule operator plugins (`/api/core/ruleOperatorPlugins`).
- `convertToComplex` query parameter to GET transform rule REST endpoint to always request a complex value transform rule.
- Add new route to display a task view plugin all by itself without headers, side bar etc.
    - Route: `/workbench/projects/:projectId/item/:pluginId/:taskId/view/:viewId`
- REST endpoint to evaluate a linking rule against the reference links only.
- New linking and transform editors:
    - User created layout and auto-layouting support.
    - Multi-word rule operator search with highlighting.
    - New node actions: select nodes, move selection
    - New edge actions: Connect edge to first free input port via dragging over node, Swap edges
    - Delete selected node(s) or edge via ++backspace++
    - Select nodes via select box (press ++shift++ + left mouse button & draw rectangle) or multi select (press ++alt++ or ++cmd++ + left clicks): Delete, move clone selection
    - Filter out 'Excel' category of operators when `hideGreyListedParameters` query parameter is set to true.
    - Supports read-only mode. Query parameter `readOnly` sets the editor in permanent read-only mode.
    - Allow to edit rule node parameters in a larger modal, so complex parameter values can be more easily edited.
        - All changes done in that modal can be updated in a single transaction (wrt. UNDO/REDO) or cancelled.
    - Inline evaluation
        - Show operator output values and evaluation scores directly inside the linking rule editor nodes
        - Support to show link to external reference links UI via `referenceLinksUrl` query parameter.
        - Support for real-time evaluation when reference links are available
- Simple path operator auto-completion

In addition to that, these changes are shipped:

- Support writing large XML files by using a memory-mapped key-value store internally.
- Request N-Triples instead of Turtle for SPARQL Construct queries in all RDF datasets, because some RDF stores run into memory problems when requesting Turtle.
- Improved performance of listing project resources on S3.
- The maximum size of the internal key value store can be configured now.
    - Default value is: `caches.persistence.maxSize=10GB`
- Improved writing to PostgresQL by using CSV import.
- If an operator writes multiple tables into a dataset that cannot hold multiple tables, an error is thrown now.
    - Example: A hierarchical transformation writes into a CSV file.
    - Previously, the last table has been written.
- Workflows can also be executed asynchronously using the "simple" workflow execution endpoints.
- If a sub-workflow is running, the workflow editor will display the full sub-workflow report.
- Keep sort config and page size when switching filters in faceted search views.
- In generated transform object rules for nested data sources (XML, JSON and RDF) keep the source path even for paths pointing at literal values, e.g. strings.
- Use DataPlatform's `facets` and `vocabusage` endpoints to fetch available properties for Knowledge Graph datasets in order to improve performance and load.
- Generated project & task identifiers: Put label-part as prefix and shorten and simplify generated random string.
- Show labels and links for dependent tasks in delete modal.
- Added parameter to "lower than" and "greater than" metrics to choose order.

In addition to that, multiple performance and stability issues were solved.

## Migration Notes

### DataIntegration

- Writing hierarchical transformations into a CSV dataset or any other datasets that are single tables will lead to an error.
- The following plugin IDs have been renamed. Old projects can still be loaded with this DI version, but reading projects written with this version using DI releases older than 22.1 can result in project loading errors:
    - Substring comparison: ID `substring` to `substringDistance`
    - Constant distance measure: ID `constant` to `constantDistance`
    - Negate transformer: ID `negate` to `negateTransformer`
- DI uses new DataPlatform endpoints for schema extraction from knowledge graphs by default, i.e. some functionality will break when run with an older DataPlatform.
    - Set `eccencaDataPlatform.sparqlSource.retrievePathsViaDpEndpoints` to false in order to use the old approach.

### DataManager

- New Graph List component with configurable lists.
    - The lists can be configured in the cmem config graph.
    - Configurations in the `<datamanager>/application.yml` are ignored any customizations need to be migrated.

### DataPlatform

- While updating, property `spring.profiles=PROFILE` needs to be replaced by `spring.config.activate.on-profile`. For further information, please see [this blog post](https://spring.io/blog/2020/08/14/config-file-processing-in-spring-boot-2-4).
- Removed custom redirect for Swagger UI under `/swagger-ui`. Swagger UI only accessible under `/swagger-ui.html` (Spring Boot Default)

### cmemc

- docker image usage
    - the cmemc docker image is now built to run as user `cmem` (id: `999`)
    - the container internally used config file has changed
        - old: `/root/.config/cmemc/config.ini`
        - new: `/config/cmemc.ini`
        - This means, mounted config volumes need to be changed!
- deprecated commands
    - `admin bootstrap`|`showcase` are deprecated
    - use `admin store bootstrap`|`showcase` instead
