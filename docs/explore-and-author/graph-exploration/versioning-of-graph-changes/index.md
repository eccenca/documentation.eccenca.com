# Versioning of Graph Changes

## Introduction

This feature keeps track of changes to your Knowledge Graphs by creating change set data based on the user's editing activities.

## Technical Background

For each editing activity (→ Save a Form), a ChangeSet resource will be created.
This resource has some metadata (user, timestamp, label) as well as links to added and deleted Statements (using RDF Reification).

The details of the used vocabulary are available at the [Changeset Vocabulary](https://vocab.org/changeset/) page.
