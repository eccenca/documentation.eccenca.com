# Build

Lift your data by integrating multiple datasets into a Knowledge Graph.

The Build stage is used to turn your legacy data points from existing datasets into an Enterprise Knowledge Graph structure. The subsections introduce the features of Corporate Memory that support this stage and provide guidance through your first lifting activities.

- :material-file-document: [Cool IRIs](./cool-iris) --- URIs and IRIs are character strings identifying the nodes and edges in the graph. Defining them is an important step in creating an exploitable Knowledge Graph for your Company.

- :material-file-document: [Define Prefixes / Namespaces](./define-prefixes-namespaces) --- Define Prefixes / Namespaces — Namespace declarations allow for abbreviation of IRIs by using a prefixed name instead of an IRI, in particular when writing SPARQL queries or Turtle.

- :material-file-document: [Extracting data from a Web API](./extracting-data-from-a-web-api) --- This tutorial shows how you can build a Knowledge Graph based on input data from a Web API.

- :material-file-document: [Introduction to the user interface](./introduction-to-the-user-interface) --- This page provides a short introduction to the BUILD / Data Integration workspace incl. projects and different tasks.

- :material-file-document: [Lift data from JSON and XML sources](./lift-data-from-json-and-xml-sources) --- This tutorial shows how you can build a Knowledge Graph based on input data from hierarchical sources like a JavaScript Object Notation file (.json) or an Extensible Markup Language file (.xml).
