# Tutorial: how to link Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to Open-Source INTelligence (OSINT)

Plan:

1. Define the need, the expected result and the use case
2. Specify the interfaces for the analysts
3. Create a knowledge graph with OSINT
	1. [MITRE ATT&CK® (STIX 2.1)](lift-data-from-STIX-2.1-data-of-mitre-attack/index.md) --- Build a Knowledge Graph from STIX 2.1 data such as the MITRE ATT&CK® datasets, a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.
	2. [Indicators of compromise rules](lift-data-from-YAML-data-of-hayabusa-sigma/index.md) (Hayabusa/Sigma Yaml).
4. [Link IDS event to a knowledge graph via a SPARQL query](link-IDS-event-to-KG/index.md)
5. [Link IDS event to a knowledge graph via advanced tools](link-IDS-event-to-KG-via-cmem/index.md)



1. Create graphs and inferences on the fly via dashboards
