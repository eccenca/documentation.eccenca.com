# Tutorial: how to link Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to Open-Source INTelligence (OSINT)

Plan:

1. Define the need, the expected result and the use case
2. Specify the interfaces for the analysts
3. Create a knowledge graph with OSINT
	1. [MITRE ATT&CK® (STIX 2.1)](lift-data-from-STIX-2.1-data-of-mitre-attack) --- Build a Knowledge Graph from STIX 2.1 data such as the MITRE ATT&CK® datasets, a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.
	2. Indicators of compromise rules (Hayabusa/Sigma Yaml).
4. Link IDS event to a knowledge graph
5. Create graphs and inferences on the fly via dashboards
