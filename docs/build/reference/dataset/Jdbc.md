# Remote SQL endpoint
<!-- This file was generated - DO NOT CHANGE IT MANUALLY -->



## General usage

The JDBC dataset supports connections to Hive, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, MariaDB, SnowFlake, Oracle Database, DB2 and PostgreSQL databases.
A login, password and JDBC URL need to be provided.
This dataset supports queries or simply schema and table names to define what to retrieve from a source DB.
When the dataset is used as a sink, queries are ignored and only schema and table parameters are used.
If the dataset is used as a sink for a hierarchical mapping, it behaves similarly to the SqlEndpoint: One table is created per entity type.

The names of the written tables are generated as follows:

- The table name of the root mapping is defined by the table parameter of the dataset.
  If the table name is empty, a name is generated from the first type of the mapping.
  Special characters are removed and the name is truncated to a maximum of 128 characters.
- For each object mapping, the table name is generated from its type.

## JDBC Connection Strings/URLs

Most of the dataset parameters are passed directly to the driver.
Please make sure that you use the correct syntax for each DBMS, otherwise you may get unintuitive errors.

Here are templates for supported database systems:
```
oracle (external driver needed): 
jdbc:oracle:thin:@{host}[:{port}]/{database}

postgres (integrated): 
jdbc:postgresql://{host}[:{port}]/[{database}]

MySQL/MariaDB (integrated): 
jdbc:{mariadb}://{host}[:{port}]/[{database}]

SnowSQL (external driver needed): 
jdbc:snowflake://{AWSAccount}.{AWS region}.snowflakecomputing.com?db={database}&schema={schema}

MSSqlServer (integrated): 
jdbc:sqlserver://{host}[:{port}];databaseName={database}

DB2 (external driver needed):
jdbc:db2//{host}[:{port}]/{database}

Trino (external driver needed)
jdbc:trino//{host}:8080/catalog/schema
```

## Read and write strategies

There are multiple read and write strategies which can be selected depending on the purpose of the dataset in a workflow.

Read strategies decide how the database is queried:

- **full-table**: Queries or wraps a complete table.
  Only the DB schema and table name need to be set.
- **query**: The given source query is passed to the database.
  The table name is not necessary in this case but a valid query in the SQL-dialect of the source database system must be provided.

Write strategies decide how a new table is written:

- **default**: An error will occur if the table exists.
  If not a new one will be created.
- **overwrite**: The old table will be removed and a new one will be created.
- **append**: Data will be appended to the existing table.
  The schema of the data written has to be the same as the existing table schema.

## Optimized Writing

Usually specific database systems have custom commands for loading large amounts of data, e.g. from a CSV file into a database table.
For some DBMS and specific JDBC dataset configurations we support these optimized methods of loading data.

Supported DBMS:

- MySQL and MariaDB (full support for versions 8.0.19+ and 10.4+, resp.):
  - if older DBMS versions are used some dataset options like 'groupBy' might not be supported but equivalent queries will
  - the same is true when older driver jars then the one provided by eccenca are used
  - both use the MariaDB JDBC driver
  - uses `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` internally
  - only applies when appending data to an existing table and having `Force Spark Execution` disabled
  - Both the server parameter `local_infile` and the client parameter `allowLoadLocalInfile` must be enabled, e.g. by adding `allowLoadLocalInfile=true` to the JDBC URL.
    For MySQL starting with version 8 the `local_infile` parameter is by default disabled!
  - If during writing to a MySQL/MariaDB a `[…] You have an error in your SQL syntax […]` error is encountered make sure ANSIquotes are used.
    `sql_mode=ANSI_QUOTES` can be set via a URL parameter to the JDBC connection string like:

    ```sh
    # MySQL
    jdbc:mysql://<host>:<port, eg. 3306>/<database>?sessionVariables=sql_mode=ANSI_QUOTES

    # MariaDB
    jdbc:mariadb://<host>:<port, eg. 3306>/<database>?sessionVariables=sql_mode=ANSI_QUOTES
    ```

## Registering JDBC drivers

More 3rd party databases are supported via adding their JDBC drivers to the classpath of Data Integration.
Drivers are usually provided by the database manufactures.
If 32 bit and 64 bit versions are provided the latter is usually needed and should aways equal the bit-level of the JVM.
To make sure that the drivers are loaded correctly, their class name (in case are jar contains multiple drivers) and location in the file system can be set with the `spark.sql.options.jdbc` option in the `dataintegration.conf` configuration file.

An example for adding both the DB2 and MySQL drivers to the Data Integration configuration file `spark.sql.options.*` section:

```raml
spark.sql.options {
  …

  # List of database identifiers to specify user provided JDBC drivers. The second part of the protocol of a JDBC URI (e.g. db2 from
  # jdbc:db2://host:port)  is used to specify the driver. For each protocol on the list a jar classname and optional download
  # location can be provided.
  jdbc.drivers = "db2,mysql"
  
  # Some database systems use licenses that are to loose or restrictive for us to ship the drivers. Therefore a path
  # to a jar file containing the driver and the name of driver can be specified here.
  jdbc.db2.jar = "/home/user/Jars/db2jcc-db2jcc4.jar"
  jdbc.mysql.jar = "/home/user/drivers/mysql.jar"

  # Name of the actual driver class for each db
  jdbc.db2.name = "com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver"
  jdbc.mysql.name = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
}
```

## Driver Priority

In general it will not work to upgrade a JDBC driver by providing an external driver for a database that is already packaged with eccenca Dataintegration.

The driver delivered with eccenca Dataintegration will be prefered. Driver names (configured via e.g. `spark.sql.options.jdbc.drivers = "mssql"`) will be ignored if JDBC URLs starting with, in this example `jdbc:mssql...` , are already supported in the dataset.                   

_Recommended DBMS versions_

- **Microsoft SQL Server 2017**: Older versions might work, but do not support the `groupBy` parameter.
- **PostgreSQL 9.5**: The `groupBy` parameter needs at least version 8.4.
- **MySQL v8.0.19**: Older versions do not support the `groupBy` parameter.
- **DB2 v11.5.x**: The `groupBy` feature needs at least version 9.7 to function.
- **Oracle 12.2.x**: The `groupBy` feature does not work for versions prior to 11g Release 2.

These limitations are the same for JDBC drivers that are older than the fully supported databases.
Queries can achieve a similar outcome if `groupBy` is not supported.


## Parameter

### JDBC Driver Connection URL

JDBC URL, must contain the database as parameter, i.g. with ;database=DBNAME or /database depending on the vendor.

- ID: `url`
- Datatype: `string`
- Default Value: `None`



### Table

### Order by

Optional column to sort the result set.
