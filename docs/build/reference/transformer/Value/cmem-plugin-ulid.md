!!! note inline end "Python Plugin"

    This operator is part of a Python Plugin Package.
    In order to use it, you need to install it,
    e.g. with cmemc.


ULID is a proposed identifier scheme, which produces time-based, random
and sortable strings. The following features are highlighted
[in the specification](https://github.com/ulid/spec):

- 128-bit compatibility with UUID
- 1.21e+24 unique ULIDs per millisecond
- Lexicographically sortable!
- Canonically encoded as a 26 character string, as opposed to the 36 character UUID
- Uses Crockford's base32 for better efficiency and readability (5 bits per character)
- Case insensitive
- No special characters (URL safe)
- Monotonic sort order (correctly detects and handles the same millisecond)

This transform plugin allows for creation of ULID based identifiers (plain or URN).
It does not support any input entities.
