# Download Nextcloud files
<!-- This file was generated - DO NOT CHANGE IT MANUALLY -->

!!! note inline end "Python Plugin"

    This operator is part of a Python Plugin Package.
    In order to use it, you need to install it,
    e.g. with cmemc.


This workflow task downloads files from a specified Nextcloud service instance.

Given the URL of the target Nextcloud instance along with your credentials, you can specify any
directory from which files should be downloaded. Additionally, you may define file patterns to
include or exclude specific files within the selected directory. The files are not downloaded to the
project resources, but are only available within the workflow itself.

#### Nextcloud List Files input
If this workflow has an input, it will take the data that comes in instead of the selected values.
This works only with the schema used in the **Nextcloud List Files** Plugin.
Make sure you still add the appropriate URL, identification and token.

#### Important:
To establish a secure connection, you must generate a dedicated [app-specific password and username](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/user_manual/de/session_management.html)
in the Security section of your Nextcloud account settings. Do not use your standard login
credentials.
