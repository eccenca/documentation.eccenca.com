# List SSH files
<!-- This file was generated - DO NOT CHANGE IT MANUALLY -->

!!! note inline end "Python Plugin"

    This operator is part of a Python Plugin Package.
    In order to use it, you need to install it,
    e.g. with cmemc.


This workflow task generates structured output from a specified SSH instance.

By providing the hostname, username, port and authentication method, you can specify the
folder from which the data should be extracted.

You can also define a regular expression to include or exclude specific files.

There is also an option to prevent files in subfolders from being included.

#### Authentication Methods:
* **Password:** Only the password will be used for authentication. The private key field is
ignored, even if filled.
* **Key:** The private key will be used for authentication. If the key is encrypted, the password
will be used to decrypt it.

#### Error handling modes:
* **Ignore:** Ignores the permission rights of files and lists them all. Skips folders when there
is no correct permission.
* **Warning:** Warns the user about files that the user has no permission rights to. Lists all files
and skips folder when there is no correct permission.
* **Error:** Throws an error when there is a single file or folder with incorrect permission rights.

#### Note:
* If a connection cannot be established within 20 seconds, a timeout occurs.
* Currently supported key types are: RSA, DSS, ECDSA, Ed25519.
* Setting the maximum amount of workers to more than 1 may cause a Channel Exception when
the amount of files is too large
