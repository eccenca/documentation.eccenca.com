|         Name | Description              |
|-------------:|:-------------------------|
 | [Add project files](addProjectFiles.md) | Adds file resources to the project that are piped into the input port. |
 | [Cancel Workflow](CancelWorkflow.md) | Cancels a workflow if a specified condition is fulfilled. A typical use case for this operator is to cancel the workflow execution if the input data is empty. |
 | [Combine CSV files](combine-csv.md) | Combine CSV files with the same structure to one dataset. |
 | [Concatenate to file](ConcatenateToFile.md) | Concatenates values into a file. |
 | [Create Embeddings](cmem_plugin_llm-CreateEmbeddings.md) | Fetch and output LLM created embeddings from input entities. |
 | [Create/Update Salesforce Objects](cmem_plugin_salesforce-workflow-operations-SobjectCreate.md) | Manipulate data in your organization’s Salesforce account. |
 | [Delete project files](deleteProjectFiles.md) | Removes file resources from the project based on a regular expression. |
 | [Distinct by](DistinctBy.md) | Removes duplicated entities based on a user-defined path. Note that this operator does not retain the order of the entities. |
 | [Download file](downloadFile.md) | Downloads a file from a given URL. |
 | [Download Nextcloud files](cmem_plugin_nextcloud-Download.md) | Download files from a given Nextcloud instance. |
 | [Download Office 365 Files](cmem_plugin_office365-Download.md) | Download files from Microsoft OneDrive or Sites |
 | [Download SSH files](cmem_plugin_ssh-Download.md) | Download files from a given SSH instance |
 | [Evaluate template](Template.md) | Evaluates a template on a sequence of entities. Can be used after a transformation or directly after datasets that output a single table, such as CSV or Excel. |
 | [Execute a command in a kubernetes pod](cmem_plugin_kubernetes-Execute.md) | Connect to a cluster, execute a command and gather the output. |

 | [Execute Instructions](cmem_plugin_llm-ExecuteInstructions.md) | Send instructions (prompt) to an LLM and process the result. |
 | [Execute REST requests](eccencaRestOperator.md) | REST operator that fetches and optionally merges data from a REST endpoint. It supports executing multiple requests either via input entities that each overwrite config parameters or via paging. If you only need to download a single file, the "Download file" operator might be the better option. Most features are currently only supported for JSON REST APIs. From multiple requests the REST operator can produce a merged JSON result, i.e. for JSON it will concatenate all results in a JSON array. Alternatively multiple results can be written directly to file (of a JSON dataset), either as a merged JSON file or one file per request inside a ZIP file. By default the output of this operator is an entity with a single property 'result', which is the (concatenated) JSON string. |

 | [Parse XML](XmlParserOperator.md) | Takes exactly one input and reads either the defined inputPath or the first value of the first entity as XML document. Then executes the given output entity schema similar to the XML dataset to construct the result entities. |
 | [Parse YAML](cmem_plugin_yaml-parse.md) | Parses files, source code or input values as YAML documents. |

 | [SPARQL Select query](sparqlSelectOperator.md) | A task that executes a SPARQL Select query on a SPARQL enabled data source and outputs the SPARQL result. If the SPARQL source is defined on a specific graph, a FROM clause will be added to the query at execution time, except when there already exists a GRAPH or FROM clause in the query. FROM NAMED clauses are not injected. |
 | [SPARQL Update query](sparqlUpdateOperator.md) | A task that outputs SPARQL Update queries for every entity from the input based on a SPARQL Update template. The output of this operator should be connected to the SPARQL datasets to which the results should be written. |
