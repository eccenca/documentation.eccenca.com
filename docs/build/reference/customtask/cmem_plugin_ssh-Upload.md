This workflow task uploads files to a given SSH instance.

folder the data should be uploaded to.

#### Authentication Methods:

ignored, even if filled.

will be used to decrypt it.

#### Note:
* If a connection cannot be established within 20 seconds, a timeout occurs.
* Currently supported key types are: RSA, DSS, ECDSA, Ed25519.
