# Create/Update Salesforce Objects
<!-- This file was generated - DO NOT CHANGE IT MANUALLY -->

!!! note inline end "Python Plugin"

    This operator is part of a Python Plugin Package.
    In order to use it, you need to install it,
    e.g. with cmemc.


This task retrieves data from an incoming workflow task (such as a SPARQL query),
and sends bulk API requests to the Salesforce Object API, in order to
manipulate data in your organization’s Salesforce account.

The working model is:
- Each entity from the input data is interpreted as a single Salesforce object of the
configured object type.
- Each path from the input entity is interpreted as a field from the Salesforce
data model (refer to  the [Salesforce Standard Objects list](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.238.0.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_list.htm)).
- The special path `id` is used to identify an object in Salesforce and switch
between update/creation mode, means:
  - If there is NO id path available, a new object is created.
  - If there IS an id path available, an update is done if the object exists.

Example:
- You want to create new Lead objects based on data from a Knowledge Graph.
- The [Lead Object Reference](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.238.0.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_lead.htm) lists the supported fields, e.g. `FirstName`,
`LastName` and `Email`.
- Your input SPARQL task looks like this. Note that the variables need
to match the field strings from the Salesforce data model:
```
SELECT DISTINCT FirstName, LastName, Email ...
```
- You select `Lead` as the Object API Name of this task and you connect both task in
the workflow in order get the result of the SPARQL task as in input for this task.
- For each SPARQL result, a new Lead is created.
