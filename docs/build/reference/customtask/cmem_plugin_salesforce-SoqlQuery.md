This task executes a custom Salesforce Object Query (SOQL)
and returns sets of tabular data from your organization’s Salesforce account.

> Use the Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) to search your organization’s
> Salesforce data for specific information. SOQL is similar to the SELECT statement in
> the widely used Structured Query Language (SQL) but is designed specifically for
> Salesforce data.
-- <cite>[developer.salesforce.com](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql.htm)</cite>

SOQL uses the SELECT statement combined with filtering statements to return sets of
data, which can optionally be ordered. For a complete description of the syntax, see
[Salesforce SOQL SELECT Syntax](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql_select.htm).

In the Advanced Options section, you can enable / disable the validation of your
SOQL Query. By default, this Parse SOQL option is set `True` (enabled).

Examples:

Retrieve all standard fields from all Lead resources. (without parser validation)
```
SELECT FIELDS(STANDARD) FROM Lead
```
Retrieve first name and last name of all Contact resources. (with parser validation)
```
SELECT Contact.Firstname, Contact.Lastname FROM Contact
```

Please refer to the [Salesforce Standard Objects list](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.238.0.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_list.htm) of the Salesforce Platform data
model in order to get an overview of the available objects and fields.
