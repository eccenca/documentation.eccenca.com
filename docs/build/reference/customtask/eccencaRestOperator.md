title: "Execute REST requests"
description: "REST operator that fetches and optionally merges data from a REST endpoint. It supports executing multiple requests either via input entities that each overwrite config parameters or via paging. If you only need to download a single file, the 'Download file' operator might be the better option. Most features are currently only supported for JSON REST APIs. From multiple requests the REST operator can produce a merged JSON result, i.e. for JSON it will concatenate all results in a JSON array. Alternatively multiple results can be written directly to file (of a JSON dataset), either as a merged JSON file or one file per request inside a ZIP file. By default the output of this operator is an entity with a single property 'result', which is the (concatenated) JSON string."

# Execute REST requests
<!-- This file was generated - DO NOT CHANGE IT MANUALLY -->



## Core parameter overview

- <a id="parameter_doc_url">`URL`</a>: The URL the request will be executed against. This value can be overwritten at execution time when the 'Read parameters from input' option
         is enabled. This value will also be adapted when a paging approach is configured, see the paging section for more details. 
- `Method`: One of the following HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE.
- `Accept`: The ACCEPT header value for content negotiation, e.g. 'application/json'.
- <a id="parameter_doc_contentType">`Content type`</a>: The CONTENT-TYPE header value. This is usually used for POST, PUT or PATCH requests when the API endpoint
                  supports multiple different MIME types and/or requires a content MIME type to be set. E.g. 'application/json'
- <a id="parameter_doc_content"></a>`Content`: The text content of a POST, PUT or PATCH request. This value can be overwritten at execution time when the
             'Read parameters from input' option is enabled.

## Authorization

If the request needs authorization following parameters should be set, else there is no authorization header sent.

- `Authorization header`: The header that is used for authorization, usually either 'Authorization' or 'Proxy-Authorization'.
- `Authorization header value`: The secret value for the authorization, i.e. password or token. This value will be encrypted
                                and cannot be accessed in the user interface anymore after saving it.
                                E.g. for OAuth the value would have the following form: `bearer <TOKEN_VALUE>`.

## Sending multiple requests

In the default configuration a single requests is sent. If multiple requests should be sent with different URLs and/or content,
the configurations for these requests must be defined via the input port of the REST operator.

- <a id="parameter_doc_readParametersFromInput">Read parameters from input</a>:
    The 'URL' and 'Content' parameter values are read from entities that are input via the input
    port of the operator. The property names are 'url' and 'content' and only overwrite the
    original parameter value if defined.

    For each input entity a separate request will be sent.
- <a id="parameter_doc_limit">Limit</a>: If set to a positive number, then only that number of input entities will be processed as requests.
- <a id="parameter_doc_offset">Offset</a>: If set to a positive number, then that many input entities will be ignored before processing them as requests.

If the option 'Read parameters from input' is enabled, it is currently always assumed that multiple requests will be sent.
The responses must either be of type JSON, then the results are merged into a JSON array, or the 'Output result as file'
option must be enabled in order to write a merged JSON or a ZIP file. See section 'Output options' for more details.

## Paging

If the REST endpoint does not return all results in a single response, multiple requests (one per page) must usually be sent in order
to fetch all results. This is currently only supported for JSON requests.

- <a id="parameter_doc_pagingMethod">`Paging method`</a>:
   There are two paging methods currently supported:

     1. `Next page full URL`: The JSON response contains the full URL of the next page. This URL will be used for the subsequent request URL.
     2. `Next page identifier`: The JSON response contains the ID of the next page. This ID will be used as query parameter value for the subsequent request.

   In both cases the path to the next page value in the response JSON must be defined via the 'Next page JSON path' parameter.
   In case of the 'Next page identifier' paging method, also the parameter 'Next page ID query parameter' must be set.
- <a id="parameter_doc_nextPageJsonPath">`Next page JSON path`</a>: The property path in the result JSON where the 'next page' URL/value is provided.
   E.g. for following response structure, the value for this parameter would be `paging/next`:

   ```
     {
       ...,
       "paging": {
         "next": "Next ID"
       }
     }
   ```
- <a id="parameter_doc_nextPageIdQueryParameter">`Next page ID query parameter`</a>: If the paging method is 'Next page identifier', this defines the query parameter name that should
  be attached to the original request URL in combination with the 'next page' value of the current response in order
  to request the next page.

## <a id="parameter_doc_httpHeaders">Setting HTTP headers</a>

- `HTTP headers`: This parameter allows to set HTTP headers of the request being made. Each line of the multi-line value should contain a single header, e.g.
  ```
  Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
  Cache-Control: max-age=0
  ```
  
## Sending a multipart HTTP file request

If the content of a POST request should be sent as file content of a multipart HTTP request, instead of the request body,
following parameter must be configured:

- <a id="parameter_doc_multipartFileParameter">`Multi-part file parameter`</a>: If set to a non-empty value then, instead of a normal POST request, a multipart/form-data
                               file upload request will be executed.
                               The value of this parameter is used as the form parameter name.
  
## Output options

By default, the response body of a request is output as value of the 'result' property of a single output entity.
If the response body needs to be processed this can e.g. be achieved with the 'Parse JSON' operator. Alternatively
the response/s can be written to a file based dataset. Currently only text based datasets are supported.

The results of multiple requests, see section 'Sending multiple requests' for details, can be written to
a single, merged file (only supported for JSON) or to a ZIP archive, i.e. a file resource that must end in '.zip'.
In the latter case an entry per request is added to the ZIP file.
Currently, the following datasets support the processing of ZIP files: JSON, XML, CSV and RDF file.

- <a id="parameter_doc_outputResultAsFile">`Output result as file`</a>: If enabled, instead of outputting a single entity, the result/s will be written directly 
                           to the file of the file-based dataset that is connected to the output of this operator.

If the option 'Read parameters from input' is enabled, it is currently always assumed that multiple requests will be sent.
The responses must either be JSON, then the results are merged into a JSON array or the 'Output result as file'
option must be enabled in order to write a merged JSON or ZIP file.
  
## Fine-tuning timeouts

If requests can take a much longer time than what can usually be expected, it is possible to increase the timeouts to
control when a request should eventually fail.

- `Request timeout`: The maximum overall time in milliseconds the request is allowed to take. Default: `10000`.
- `Connection timeout`: The maximum time in milliseconds the request is allowed to establish a connection to the server. Default: `5000`.
- `Read timeout`: The maximum time a request is allowed to stay idle, i.e. the time while it receives no data. Usually this
   should be greater than the time span between the request being sent and the first data being received. Default: `10000`

## Throttling requests

If a lot of requests are sent via the 'Read parameters from input' option, it can make sense to throttle the number
of requests sent in a specific time span.

- `Delay between requests`: The delay between subsequent requests in milliseconds. Default: `0`.

## Error handling

Following parameters can be tuned in order to decide when an execution should be considered as failed.

- `Retries per request`: How often a single request configuration (URL, content) should be retried before considering this
                         request configuration as failed. Default: `3`
- `Abort when request fails`: When enabled, if a single request configuration eventually fails, i.e. it reaches its max. retry count,
                              the overall execution of the REST operator will fail.
- `Max failed requests`: If set to a value greater 0, the execution will abort if more than the given number of request configurations 
                         have failed (reached max. retries). This can be used if a number of failed requests can be tolerated.
                         When 'Abort when request fails' is enabled, this option is ignored.

## Propagating the request URL

If having the request URL in the response data is needed, following parameter needs to be configured:

- <a id="parameter_doc_urlProperty">`URL property`</a>: If this parameter is non-empty the request URL will be added to the response JSON object. It will be added as value to
                  a property with the specified name in the root level of the response JSON object.
                  This is mostly relevant if the request URL cannot be re-constructed from the response data. Only supported for JSON responses.

- ID: `maxFailedRequests`
- Datatype: `int`
- Default Value: `0`



### Paging method

There are two paging methods currently supported: 1. Next page full URL: The JSON response contains the full URL of the next page. This URL will be used for the subsequent request. 2. Next page identifier: The JSON response contains the ID of the next page. This ID will be used as query parameter for the subsequent request. In both cases the path to the next page value in the response JSON must be defined via the 'Next page JSON path' parameter. In case of the 'Identifier next page parameter' paging method, also the parameter 'Next page ID query parameter' must be set.

- ID: `pagingMethod`
- Datatype: `enumeration`
- Default Value: `none`



### Next page JSON path

The path to the JSON value containing the next page value of the JSON response, e.g. paging/next. The path syntax follows the Silk path syntax, but only allows forward paths.

- Default Value: `None`



### Next page ID query parameter

The query parameter name for the next page ID that should be attached to the next page URI request. This is necessary for the 'Next page identifier' paging method.

- ID: `nextPageIdQueryParameter`
- Datatype: `string`
- Default Value: `None`



### Output result as file

If a file based dataset is connected to the output of the REST operator, then this option can be enabled in order to overwrite the file resource of the connected dataset. This allows for handling the result of the REST request/s as a normal dataset. If a non-file based dataset is connected to this operator the execution will fail. If disabled, a single entity with a single property 'result' will be output that contains the (merged) result.

- ID: `outputResultAsFile`
- Datatype: `boolean`
- Default Value: `false`



### URL property

If this is non-empty, a property is created in the root JSON object (if it exists) with the same name that has the request URL as value. This is mostly relevant if the request URL cannot be re-constructed from the response data. Only supported for JSON response data.

- ID: `urlProperty`
- Datatype: `string`
- Default Value: `None`





## Advanced Parameter
