# Execute commands via SSH
<!-- This file was generated - DO NOT CHANGE IT MANUALLY -->

!!! note inline end "Python Plugin"

    This operator is part of a Python Plugin Package.
    In order to use it, you need to install it,
    e.g. with cmemc.


This workflow task executes commands on a given SSH instance.

By providing the hostname, username, port and authentication method, you can specify the
folder in which the command should be executed in.

#### Input Methods:
* **No input:** The command will be executed with no input attached to the plugin. Stdin
is non-existent in this case.
* **File input:** The command will be executed with the stdin being represented by the
files that are connected via the input port of the plugin. This also allows for looping
over multiple files executing the same command over them.


#### Output Methods:
* **Structured process output:** The output will produce entities with its own schema including
the stdout and stderr as well as the exit code to confirm the execution of the command.
* **File output:** The stdout will be converted into a file a be provided for further use.
* **No output:** The output port will be closed.

#### Authentication Methods:
* **Password:** Only the password will be used for authentication. The private key field is
ignored, even if filled.
* **Key:** The private key will be used for authentication. If the key is encrypted, the password
will be used to decrypt it.

#### Note:
* If a connection cannot be established within 20 seconds, a timeout occurs.
* Currently supported key types are: RSA, DSS, ECDSA, Ed25519.
