!!! note inline end "Python Plugin"

    This operator is part of a Python Plugin Package.
    In order to use it, you need to install it,
    e.g. with cmemc.


This workflow task creates a structured output from a specified Nextcloud
service instance.

Given the URL of the target Nextcloud instance along with your credentials, you can specify any
directory from which data should be extracted. Additionally, you may define file patterns to
include or exclude specific files within the selected directory.

#### Important:
To establish a secure connection, you must generate a dedicated [app-specific password and username](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/user_manual/de/session_management.html)
in the Security section of your Nextcloud account settings. Do not use your standard login
credentials.
