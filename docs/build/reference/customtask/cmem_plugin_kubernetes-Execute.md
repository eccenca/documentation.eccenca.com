<!-- This file was generated - DO NOT CHANGE IT MANUALLY -->

!!! note inline end "Python Plugin"

    This operator is part of a Python Plugin Package.
    In order to use it, you need to install it,
    e.g. with cmemc.


This plugin enables execution of commands inside Kubernetes pods and captures their output.

## Features

- Supports multiple connection types:
  - **In-cluster**: Uses the service account kubernetes gives to pods
    (for plugins running inside k8s)
  - **Explicit config**: Uses a YAML kubeconfig file for external connections
- Executes shell commands in specified pods within namespaces
- Captures both stdout and stderr output
- Returns command output as a file entity for further processing
- Includes namespace listing functionality to verify cluster access and connectivity

## Output

Command output is captured and returned as a text file entity that can be consumed by
downstream workflow tasks.

## Use Cases

- Running external pipelines
- Running diagnostic commands in production pods
- Executing maintenance scripts from within or outside the cluster
- Gathering system information and logs
- Performing health checks and troubleshooting
