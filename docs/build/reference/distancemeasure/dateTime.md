Distance between two date time values (xsd:dateTime format) in seconds.

### Characteristics
This distance measure is not normalized, i.e., all distances start at 0 (exact match) and increase the more different the values are.

Compares single values (as opposed to sequences of values). If multiple values are provided, all values are compared and the lowest distance is returned.

## Parameter

`None`

## Advanced Parameter
