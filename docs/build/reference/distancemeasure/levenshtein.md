# Normalized Levenshtein distance
<!-- This file was generated - DO NOT CHANGE IT MANUALLY -->



Normalized Levenshtein distance. Divides the edit distance by the length of the longer string.

## Characteristics
This distance measure is normalized, i.e., all distances are between 0 (exact match) and 1 (no similarity).

Compares single values (as opposed to sequences of values). If multiple values are provided, all values are compared and the lowest distance is returned.
## Examples

**Notation:** List of values are represented via square brackets. Example: `[first, second]` represents a list of two values "first" and "second".

---
**Returns 0 for equal strings:**

* Input values:
    - Source: `[John]`
    - Target: `[John]`

* Returns: `0.0`


---
**Returns 1/4 if two strings of length 4 differ by one edit operation:**

* Input values:
    - Source: `[John]`
    - Target: `[Jxhn]`

* Returns: `0.25`


---
**Normalizes the edit distance by the length of the longer string:**

* Input values:
    - Source: `[John]`
    - Target: `[Jhn]`

* Returns: `0.25`


---
**Returns the maximum distance of 1 for completely different strings:**

* Input values:
    - Source: `[John]`
    - Target: `[Clara]`

* Returns: `1.0`
