# Distance Measures
<!-- This file was generated - DO NOT CHANGE IT MANUALLY -->

Distance Measures compute a distance metric between two sets of strings.

|         Name | Description              |
|-------------:|:-------------------------|
 | [CJK reading distance](cjkReadingDistance.md) | CJK Reading Distance. |
 | [Compare physical quantities](PhysicalQuantitiesDistance.md) | Computes the distance between two physical quantities. |
 | [Constant similarity value](constantDistance.md) | Always returns a constant similarity value. |
 | [Cosine](cosine.md) | Cosine Distance Measure. |
 | [Date](date.md) | The distance in days between two dates ('YYYY-MM-DD' format). |
 | [DateTime](dateTime.md) | Distance between two date time values (xsd:dateTime format) in seconds. |
 | [Dice coefficient](dice.md) | Dice similarity coefficient. |
 | [Geographical distance](wgs84.md) | Computes the geographical distance between two points. Author: Konrad Höffner (MOLE subgroup of Research Group AKSW, University of Leipzig) |
 | [Greater than](greaterThan.md) | Checks if the source value is greater than the target value. If both strings are numbers, numerical order is used for comparison. Otherwise, alphanumerical order is used. |
 | [Inequality](inequality.md) | Returns success if values are not equal, failure otherwise. |
 | [Inside numeric interval](insideNumericInterval.md) | Checks if a number is contained inside a numeric interval, such as '1900 - 2000'. |
 | [Is substring](isSubstring.md) | Checks if a source value is a substring of a target value. |
 | [Jaccard](jaccard.md) | Jaccard similarity coefficient. Divides the matching tokens by the number of distinct tokens from both inputs. |
 | [Jaro distance](jaro.md) | Matches strings based on the Jaro distance metric. |
 | [Jaro-Winkler distance](jaroWinkler.md) | Matches strings based on the Jaro-Winkler distance measure. |
 | [Korean phoneme distance](koreanPhonemeDistance.md) | Korean phoneme distance. |
 | [Korean translit distance](koreanTranslitDistance.md) | Transliterated Korean distance. |
 | [Levenshtein distance](levenshteinDistance.md) | Levenshtein distance. Returns a distance value between zero and the size of the string. |
 | [Lower than](lowerThan.md) | Checks if the source value is lower than the target value. |
 | [Normalized Levenshtein distance](levenshtein.md) | Normalized Levenshtein distance. Divides the edit distance by the length of the longer string. |
 | [Numeric equality](numericEquality.md) | Compares values numerically instead of their string representation as the 'String Equality' operator does. Allows to set the needed precision of the comparison. A value of 0.0 means that the values must represent exactly the same (floating point) value, values higher than that allow for a margin of tolerance. |
 | [Numeric similarity](num.md) | Computes the numeric distance between two numbers. |
 | [qGrams](qGrams.md) | String similarity based on q-grams (by default q=2). |
 | [Relaxed equality](relaxedEquality.md) | Return success if strings are equal, failure otherwise. Lower/upper case and differences like ö/o, n/ñ, c/ç etc. are treated as equal. |
 | [Soft Jaccard](softjaccard.md) | Soft Jaccard similarity coefficient. Same as Jaccard distance but values within an levenhstein distance of 'maxDistance' are considered equivalent. |
 | [Starts with](startsWith.md) | Returns success if the first string starts with the second string, failure otherwise. |
 | [String equality](equality.md) | Checks for equality of the string representation of the given values. Returns success if string values are equal, failure otherwise. For a numeric comparison of values use the 'Numeric Equality' comparator. |
 | [Substring comparison](substringDistance.md) | Return 0 to 1 for strong similarity to weak similarity. Based on the paper: Stoilos, Giorgos, Giorgos Stamou, and Stefanos Kollias. "A string metric for ontology alignment." The Semantic Web-ISWC 2005. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2005. 624-637. |
 | [Token-wise distance](tokenwiseDistance.md) | Token-wise string distance using the specified metric. |
