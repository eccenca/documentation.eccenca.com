# admin metrics Command Group
<!-- This file was generated - DO NOT CHANGE IT MANUALLY -->

List and get metrics.

This command group consists of commands for reading and listing internal monitoring metrics of eccenca Corporate Memory. A deployment consists of multiple jobs (e.g. DP, DI), which provide multiple metric families for an endpoint.

Each metric family can consist of different samples identified by labels with a name and a value (dimensions). A metric has a specific type (counter, gauge, summary and histogram) and additional metadata.

Please have a look at https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/ for further details.


## admin metrics get

Get sample data of a metric.

```shell-session title="Usage"
$ cmemc admin metrics get [OPTIONS] METRIC_ID
```




A metric of a specific job is identified by a metric ID. Possible metric IDs of a job can be retrieved with the `metrics list` command. A metric can contain multiple samples. These samples are distinguished by labels (name and value).



??? info "Options"
    ```text

    --job [DP]               The job from which the metrics data is fetched.
                             [default: DP]
  
    --filter <TEXT TEXT>...  A set of label name/value pairs in order to filter
                             the samples of the requested metric family. Each
                             metric has a different set of labels with different
                             values. In order to get a list of possible label
                             names and values, use the command without this
                             option. The label names are then shown as column
                             headers and label values as cell values of this
                             column.
  
    --enforce-table          A single sample value will be returned as plain
                             text instead of the normal table. This allows for
                             more easy integration with scripts. This flag
                             enforces the use of tabular output, even for single
                             row tables.
  
    --raw                    Outputs raw prometheus sample classes.
    ```

## admin metrics inspect

Inspect a metric.

```shell-session title="Usage"
$ cmemc admin metrics inspect [OPTIONS] METRIC_ID
```




This command outputs the data of a metric. The first table includes basic metadata about the metric. The second table includes sample labels and values.



??? info "Options"
    ```text

    --job [DP]  The job from which the metrics data is fetched.  [default: DP]
    --raw       Outputs raw JSON of the table data.
    ```

## admin metrics list

List metrics for a specific job.

```shell-session title="Usage"
$ cmemc admin metrics list [OPTIONS]
```




For each metric, the output table shows the metric ID, the type of the metric, a count of how many labels (label names) are describing the samples (L) and a count of how many samples are currently available for a metric (S).



??? info "Options"
    ```text

    --job [DP]  The job from which the metrics data is fetched.  [default: DP]
    --id-only   Lists metric identifier only. This is useful for piping the IDs
                into other commands.
  
    --raw       Outputs (sorted) JSON dict, parsed from the metrics API output.
    ```
