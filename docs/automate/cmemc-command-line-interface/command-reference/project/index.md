# project Command Group
<!-- This file was generated - DO NOT CHANGE IT MANUALLY -->

List, import, export, create, delete or open projects.

Projects are identified by a `PROJECT_ID`.

!!! note
    To get a list of existing projects, execute the `project list` command or use tab-completion.



## project open

Open projects in the browser.

```shell-session title="Usage"
$ cmemc project open PROJECT_IDS...
```




With this command, you can open a project in the workspace in your browser to change them.

The command accepts multiple project IDs which results in opening multiple browser tabs.



## project list

List available projects.

```shell-session title="Usage"
$ cmemc project list [OPTIONS]
```




Outputs a list of project IDs which can be used as reference for the project create, delete, export and import commands.



??? info "Options"
    ```text

    --raw       Outputs raw JSON.
    --id-only   Lists only project identifier and no labels or other metadata.
                This is useful for piping the IDs into other commands.
    ```

## project export

Export projects to files.

```shell-session title="Usage"
$ cmemc project export [OPTIONS] [PROJECT_IDS]...
```




Projects can be exported with different export formats. The default type is a zip archive which includes metadata as well as dataset resources. If more than one project is exported, a file is created for each project. By default, these files are created in the current directory with a descriptive name (see `--template` option default).

!!! note
    Projects can be listed by using the `project list` command.


You can use the template string to create subdirectories.

```shell-session title="Example"
$ cmemc config list | parallel -I% cmemc -c % project export --all -t "dump/{{connection}}/{{date}}-{{id}}.project"
```




??? info "Options"
    ```text

    -a, --all                     Export all projects.
    -o, --overwrite               Overwrite existing files. This is a dangerous
                                  option, so use it with care.
  
    --output-dir DIRECTORY        The base directory, where the project files
                                  will be created. If this directory does not
                                  exist, it will be silently created.  [default:
                                  .]
  
    --type TEXT                   Type of the exported project file(s). Use the
                                  --help-types option or tab completion to see a
                                  list of possible types.  [default: xmlZip]
  
    -t, --filename-template TEXT  Template for the export file name(s). Possible
                                  placeholders are (Jinja2): {{id}} (the project
                                  ID), {{connection}} (from the --connection
                                  option) and {{date}} (the current date as
                                  YYYY-MM-DD). The file suffix will be appended.
                                  Needed directories will be created.  [default:
                                  {{date}}-{{connection}}-{{id}}.project]
  
    --extract                     Export projects to a directory structure
                                  instead of a ZIP archive. Note that the
                                  --filename-template option is ignored here.
                                  Instead, a sub-directory per exported project
                                  is created under the output directory. Also
                                  note that not all export types are
                                  extractable.
  
    --help-types                  Lists all possible export types.
    ```

## project import

Import a project from a file or directory.

```shell-session title="Usage"
$ cmemc project import [OPTIONS] PATH [PROJECT_ID]
```




```shell-session title="Example"
$ cmemc project import my_project.zip my_project
```




??? info "Options"
    ```text

    -o, --overwrite  Overwrite an existing project. This is a dangerous option,
                     so use it with care.
    ```

## project delete

```shell-session title="Usage"
$ cmemc project delete [OPTIONS] [PROJECT_IDS]...
```




This command deletes existing data integration projects from Corporate Memory.

!!! warning
    Projects will be deleted without prompting!


!!! note
    Projects can be listed with the `project list` command.




??? info "Options"
    ```text

    -a, --all   Delete all projects. This is a dangerous option, so use it with
                care.
    ```

## project create

Create projects.

```shell-session title="Usage"
$ cmemc project create [OPTIONS] PROJECT_IDS...
```




This command creates one or more new projects. Existing projects will not be overwritten.

!!! note
    Projects can be listed by using the `project list` command.




??? info "Options"
    ```text

    --from-transformation TEXT  This option can be used to explicitly create the
                                link specification, which is internally executed
                                when using the mapping suggestion of a
                                transformation task. You need the task ID of the
                                transformation task.
    ```

## project reload

Reload projects from the workspace provider.

```shell-session title="Usage"
$ cmemc project reload [OPTIONS] [PROJECT_IDS]...
```




This command reloads all tasks of a project from the workspace provider. This is similar to the `workspace reload` command, but for a single project only.

!!! note
    You need this in case you changed project data externally or loaded a project which uses plugins which are not installed yet. In this case, install the plugin(s) and reload the project afterwards.


!!! warning
    Depending on the size your datasets esp. your Knowledge Graphs, reloading a project can take a long time to re-create the path caches.




??? info "Options"
    ```text

    -a, --all   Reload all projects
    ```
