# Requirements

This page lists software and hardware requirements for eccenca Corporate Memory deployments.
For a general overview of a deployment setup please refer to the [System Architecture](../system-architecture/index.md).

## Minimal Setup

A minimal single-node deployment for testing/evaluation purposes means:

-   no memory consuming linking and transformation workflows,
-   nearly no concurrent users.

Depending on how much RAM is dedicated to the triple store, Knowledge Graphs up to several million triples can be built and served.

-   Operating System / Hardware
    -   Bare metal server or VM with Debian based linux OS (see [Installation](./../installation/index.md) for details)
    -   16 GB RAM
    -   100 GB free disk space (10 GB for docker images + data + logs over time)
    -   docker and docker compose (we deliver an orchestration including all needed components)

For an example of a single-node installation refer to the following scenarios:

-   [Scenario: Local Installation](../installation/scenario-local-installation/index.md)
-   [Scenario: RedHat Enterprise Linux 7](../installation/scenario-redhat-enterprise-linux-7/index.md)
-   [Scenario: Single Node Cloud Installation](../installation/scenario-single-node-cloud-installation/index.md)

## Typical Setup

In a typical deployment all components are installed in a kubernetes cluster.

The following numbers are based on existing customer deployments running Knowledge Graphs up to 300 million triples.

|                       Component | CPU             | Memory           |
| ------------------------------: | :-------------- | :--------------- |
|                 eccenca Explore | \>= 2 cores[^u] | \>= 4 GB RAM     |
| eccenca Build (DataIntegration) | \>= 4 cores[^w] | \>= 8 GB RAM[^w] |
|             Triple / Quad Store | \>= 8 cores[^u] | \>= 16 GB RAM[^t] |
|   Keycloak incl. PostgreSQL[^c] | 2 cores         | \>= 2 GB RAM     |

For GraphDB always also have a look at [GraphDB recommendations](https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/11.0/requirements.html#hardware-sizing).

## Clients

### Browser / Web Client

We support all (LTS/ESR) versions of the below listed browsers that are actively supported be the respective publishers:

-   Microsoft Edge > v88.0
-   Google Chrome or Chromium > v92.0
-   Firefox > v78.0

!!! note

    Internet Explorer 11 as well as Safari Browser are not officially supported. IE11 is reported not to work.

### Command Line Client (cmemc)

cmemc is supported by the following Python versions: [![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/cmem-cmemc.svg "Python Version"){ .off-glb }](https://pypi.org/project/cmem-cmemc/)

There is also a [docker image](../../automate/cmemc-command-line-interface/invocation/docker-image/index.md) available.

[^u]: Needs to be scaled with concurrent users.
[^w]: Depends on the Build (DataIntegration) workflows.
[^t]: Needs to be scaled with the amount of triples.
[^c]: In cloud deployments, this could / will be a cloud service.
