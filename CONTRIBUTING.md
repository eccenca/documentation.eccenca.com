## What should I know before I get started?

<details>
  <summary>Extend section</summary>

This documentation project is made with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [material theme for mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
The documentation is written in [markdown](https://commonmark.org/) and the project dependency management is done by [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
We suggest to use a specialized markdown editor such as [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) if you plan to not just fix a typo.

The following tools you need locally to get started:

- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [task](https://taskfile.dev/)
- git, markdown editor

On a few OS distributions (e.g. Arch Linux) the tool/binary is named `go-task`.

The following shell session demonstrates the local workflow (after you forked the repository):

``` shell-session
$ git clone <your repository fork>
Cloning into 'documentation.eccenca.com'...
...
$ cd documentation.eccenca.com/
$ task serve
task: [install] poetry install
Creating virtualenv in ...
Installing dependencies from lock file

Package operations: 62 installs, 0 updates, 0 removals
...
task: [serve] poetry run mkdocs serve
INFO     -  Building documentation...
INFO     -  Cleaning site directory
INFO     -  Documentation built in 20.03 seconds
INFO     -  [16:25:36] Watching paths for changes: 'docs', 'mkdocs.yml', 'overrides'
INFO     -  [16:25:36] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

After that, you can go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) and start changing / adding files in the docs directory.
Changes are served live on localhost.

Note that some python packages need corresponding C libraries, which you may have to install as well.
Have a look at the [mkdocs-material documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-social-cards/?h=cairo#dependencies) and the [build plan](https://github.com/eccenca/documentation.eccenca.com/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml#L54) for a list.

## General Repository rules

<details>
  <summary>Extend section</summary>

- always create a directory + `index.md`, e.g. `my-topic/index.md` ([Example](https://github.com/eccenca/documentation.eccenca.com/tree/main/docs/automate/cmemc-command-line-interface))
- add new pages to the `.pages` file to add them in the right order and with correct title to the menu ([Example](https://github.com/eccenca/documentation.eccenca.com/blob/main/docs/automate/cmemc-command-line-interface/.pages))
- put images side by side to the `index.md` ([Example](https://github.com/eccenca/documentation.eccenca.com/tree/main/docs/release-notes/corporate-memory-22-1))
- do not use images for icons esp. icons from the application
    - use eccenca icons, e.g. [:eccenca-application-queries:](https://github.com/eccenca/documentation.eccenca.com/blob/main/overrides/.icons/eccenca/application-queries.svg) -> [list](https://github.com/eccenca/documentation.eccenca.com/tree/main/overrides/.icons/eccenca)
    - use theme icons where no eccenca icon is available -> [list](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/icons-emojis/#search)
- name image files properly (not just `Screenshot.xxx.png`, [Example](https://github.com/eccenca/documentation.eccenca.com/tree/main/docs/release-notes/corporate-memory-22-1))
- used advanced features where suitable
  - [Admonitions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/#usage) (esp. use notes and warnings where needed) -> see Admonition section for more details
  - [Code Blocks](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/code-blocks/#usage) (e.g. enable highlightning and add a title)
  - [Content Tabs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/content-tabs/#usage) (to structure complex pages)
- code blocks:
  - do not use line numbers except you refer to it in the text
  - use correct syntax highlightning (often used: `shell-session`, `bash`, `sparql`, `turtle`, `json`) -> [list of syntax IDs](https://pygments.org/docs/lexers/)
  - do not confuse `shell-session` with `bash` (the first is a terminal output, the latter a script syntax)
  - when using `shell-session`, use `$ ` as the prompt
 - Links:
    - do not use absolute links for internal documents, e.g. `https://documentation.eccenca.com/latest/...`
    - do not use base-relative links, e.g. `/automate/...`
    - use relative links to `index.md` files

  <summary>Extend section</summary>

- do not use a cluttered desktop
- do not show other esp. personal project artifacts then relevant for the tutorial / feature to show
- select cropping area carefully (omit backgrounds, lines on the edges, etc.)
- use the same or a similar area for similar screens
- all relevant elements should be clearly visible and not be truncated
- irrelevant elements / details should be omitted completely and not be half visible

- keep an equal distance of all visible elements to the edges of the screenshot
