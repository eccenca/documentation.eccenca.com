## What should I know before I get started?

This documentation project is made with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [material theme for mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
The documentation is written in [markdown](https://commonmark.org/) and the project dependency management is done by [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
We suggest to use a specialized markdown editor such as [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) if you plan to not just fix a typo.

The following tools you need locally to get started:

- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [task](https://taskfile.dev/)
- git, markdown editor

The following shell session demonstrates the local workflow (after you forked the repository):

``` shell-session
$ git clone <your repository fork>
Cloning into 'documentation.eccenca.com'...
...
$ cd documentation.eccenca.com/
$ task serve
task: [install] poetry install
Creating virtualenv in ...
Installing dependencies from lock file

Package operations: 62 installs, 0 updates, 0 removals

task: [serve] poetry run mkdocs serve

INFO     -  [16:25:36] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```
After that, you can go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) and start changing / adding files in the docs directory.
Changes are served live on localhost.

## Repository rules

- always create a directory + `index.md`, e.g. `my-topic/index.md` ([Example](https://github.com/eccenca/documentation.eccenca.com/tree/main/docs/automate/cmemc-command-line-interface))
- add new pages to the `.pages` file to add them in the right order and with correct title to the menu ([Example](https://github.com/eccenca/documentation.eccenca.com/blob/main/docs/automate/cmemc-command-line-interface/.pages))
- put images side by side to the `index.md` ([Example](https://github.com/eccenca/documentation.eccenca.com/tree/main/docs/release-notes/corporate-memory-22-1))
- do not use images for icons esp. icons from the application - use theme icons instead, e.g. `:material-play:` -> [icon list](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/icons-emojis/#search)
- name image files properly (not just `Screenshot.xxx.png`, [Example](https://github.com/eccenca/documentation.eccenca.com/tree/main/docs/release-notes/corporate-memory-22-1))
- used advanced features where suitable
  - [Admonitions](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/#usage) (esp. use notes and warnings where needed)
  - [Code Blocks](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/code-blocks/#usage) (e.g. enable highlightning and add a title)
  - [Content Tabs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/content-tabs/#usage) (to structure complex pages)
- code blocks:
  - do not use line numbers except you refer to it in the text
  - use correct syntax highlightning (often used: `shell-session`, `bash`, `sparql`, `turtle`, `json`) -> [list of syntax IDs](https://pygments.org/docs/lexers/)
  - do not confuse `shell-session` with `bash` (the first is a terminal output, the latter a script syntax)
  - when using `shell-session`, use `$ ` as the prompt
 - Links:
    - do not use absolute links for internal documents, e.g. `https://documentation.eccenca.com/latest/...`
    - do not use base-relative links, e.g. `/automate/...`
    - use relative links to `index.md` files
